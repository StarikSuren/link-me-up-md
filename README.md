# About
Obsidian plugin that can look up for files created or modified today and create list of them in active note. 
Can be useful if you live in chaos and fail to remember what happened today or if you have bad discipline to keep youself organaized (like me) 

# Usage
1. Open some note (like daily note)
2. Command palette (default is Ctrl+P) -> LinkMeUp: list files in vault
3. List of created/modified today files will appear in the bottom of opened note
